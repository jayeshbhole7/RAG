- *Additional Feature* : There is a Chatbot as an option to generate your own personalized queries.

## Tech Stack

- Libraries and Frameworks : `LangChain`, `PyPdf`, `Tabula`, `Streamlit`, `Pandas`
- Models: Cohere's `embed-english-v3.0` and `command-r`

## Setup on Local Machine

Worked with Python 3.11 anything above will probably work.

1. Clone the repo

Â ```sh
Â git clone https://github.com/jojocoder28/Mutual_Fund_Chatbot
Â ```
Â ---
2. Create and activate virtual environment
```sh
cd Mutual_Fund_Chatbot
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```
---
Â 3. Install Requirements

Â ```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
---

4. For the local machine you need to uncomment the import tabula and tabula.convert_into(uploaded_file[0], f"db/{index_name}/table.csv",pages='all', output_format='csv') in the 141st line of pages/Upload_Files.py

---

5. Create a .env file and put your [Cohere API Key](https://dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys) as COHERE_API_KEY and OpenAI API key as OPENAI_API_KEY

```sh
COHERE_API_KEY=[YOUR COHERE API KEY GOES HERE]
```

The chatbot uses Cohere's embed-english-v3.0 and command-r by default.

##
6. Run Chatbot.py

```sh
streamlit run .\Report_Generator.py
```
